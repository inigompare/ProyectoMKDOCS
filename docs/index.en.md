# MkDocs Project Documentation

![Project Cover](img/portada.png)

## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to the **Meta-Documentation** of this project. This website documents, step by step, the complete technical process to **create, configure and deploy** a static website using static site generators (SSG) in a **Windows with PowerShell** environment.

!!! info "What is a Meta-Documentation?"
This site is an example of **recursive documentation**: you are reading the documentation about how this very documentation was created. It is a practical exercise that shows the entire real workflow, including the errors found and their solutions.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main objective is to demonstrate mastery of the following technical competencies of the **ASIR (Network Computer Systems Administration)** program:

- [x] Installation and configuration of development environments
- [x] Use of version control tools (Git)
- [x] Deployment of web applications in the cloud
- [x] Technical problem solving (troubleshooting)
- [x] Professional technical documentation

## 🚀 Where to Start?

??? tip "Reading Recommendation"

    If this is your first time configuring MkDocs, I recommend following the sections in order:

    1. **Environment Setup** - Install the necessary tools
    2. **Project Configuration** - Understand the file structure
    3. **Troubleshooting** - Learn from the real errors I encountered
    4. **Conclusions** - Reflections and additional resources
